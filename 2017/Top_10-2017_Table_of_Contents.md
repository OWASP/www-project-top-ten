<br>
All OWASP tools, documents, videos, presentations, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security.
<br><br>
We advocate approaching application security as a people, process, and technology problem, because the most effective approaches to application security require improvements in these areas.
<br><br>
OWASP is a new kind of organization. Our freedom from commercial pressures allows us to provide unbiased, practical, and cost-effective information about application security.
<br><br>
OWASP is not affiliated with any technology company, although we support the informed use of commercial security technology. OWASP produces many types of materials in a collaborative, transparent, and open way.
<br><br>
The OWASP Foundation is the non-profit entity that ensures the project's long-term success. Almost everyone associated with OWASP is a volunteer, including the OWASP board, chapter leaders, project leaders, and project members. We support innovative security research with grants and infrastructure.
