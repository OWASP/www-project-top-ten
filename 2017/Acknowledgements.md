We'd like to thank the many organizations that contributed their vulnerability data to support the 2017 update:<br>

For the first time, all the data contributed to a Top 10 release, and the full list of contributors is [publicly available](https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/tree/master/2017/datacall/submissions).

And everyone else who provided feedback via Twitter, email, and other means.

We would be remiss not to mention that Dirk Wetter, Jim Manico, and Osama Elnaggar have provided extensive assistance. Also, Chris Frohoff and Gabriel Lawrence provided invaluable support in the writing of the new [A8:2017-Insecure Deserialization](A8_2017-Insecure_Deserialization) risk.
