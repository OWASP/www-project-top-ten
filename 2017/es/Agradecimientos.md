We'd like to thank the many organizations that contributed their vulnerability data to support the 2017 update:<br>
<br>
{% include acknowlegements_data_contributors_table.html %}
<br>
For the first time, all the data contributed to a Top 10 release, and the full list of contributors is [publicly available](https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/tree/master/2017/datacall/submissions).
{% include t10_subsection.html text="Acknowledgements to Individual Contributors" pos="whole" %}
<br>
Weâ€™d like to thank the individual contributors who spent many hours collectively contributing to the Top 10 in GitHub.<br>

{% include acknowlegements_individual_contributors_table.html %}
<br>
And everyone else who provided feedback via Twitter, email, and other means.
<br>
We would be remiss not to mention that Dirk Wetter, Jim Manico, and Osama Elnaggar have provided extensive assistance. Also, Chris Frohoff and Gabriel Lawrence provided invaluable support in the writing of the new [A8:2017-Insecure Deserialization](A8_2017-Insecure_Deserialization) risk.
